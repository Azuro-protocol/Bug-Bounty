# AzuroV1 Bug Bounty 

# ****Program Overview****

Azuro Protocol - decentralized betting protocol. Azuro utilizes smart-contracts to build a decentralized betting protocol deploying an innovative solution for liquidity provision and allocation. Unlike existing and most new projects, Azuro is the first to introduce pooled liquidity to scale prediction markets. As a result betting becomes transparent and trustless, while depth of betting events, markets and UX remains as good as it gets.

Azuro is running  bug bounty program focused on Azuro Protocolâ€™s liquidity pool solution( liquidity tree). 

The bug bounty program is focused around its smart contracts and is mostly concerned with the loss of user funds.
